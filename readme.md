- Dictionaries
- Conditionals
<br>
2. Personal Expense Tracker - Log spendings into a CSV 
- Inputs
- File Handling
<br>
3. Website Uptime Checker
- keep script running 24/7
- requests
- loops
- scheduling in general
<br>
4. PDF Merger 
- external libraries / packages
<br>
5. Weather App
- pull live data from API
- handling JSON's
<br>
6. [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/pythorine/rock-paper-scissors)
- just my first test project
